NTPUSU Regulatory Typesetting Tool

## Usage
1. Go to [Regulatory Typesetting Tool](https://ntpusgr.lionfree.net/new_reg/). (set up using free web hosting, which can be unstable, and we look forward to improvements, if supported.)
2. Follow the Formatting Guidelines (as below) and fill in the plain text of the regulation in the left side, and you will get the processed source code in the right-side box. Copy it.
